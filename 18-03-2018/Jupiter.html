    <h1>Jupiter</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
            It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half 
            times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn 
            are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. 
            Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity.[13] The Romans named it after 
            their god Jupiter.[14] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude 
            of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[15] and making it on 
            average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
