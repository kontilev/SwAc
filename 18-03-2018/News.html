            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to 
            harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth 
            formed over 4.5 billion years ago.[24][25][26] Earth's gravity interacts with other 
            objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. 
            Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. 
            During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.[n 5]
            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's 
            surface.[27] The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, 
            stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.[28] 
            Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.
            Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the 
            surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, 
            mostly by oceans.[29] The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together 
            have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority 
            of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the 
            Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core 
            that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
            Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect 
            the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. 
            Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. 
            Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological 
            history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.[30][31] In the history of the Earth, biodiversity 
            has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. 
            Over 99% of all species[32] that ever lived on Earth are extinct.[33][34] Estimates of the number 
            of species on Earth today vary widely;[35][36][37] most species have not been described.[38] 
            Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for 
            their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, 
            the world has about 200 sovereign states.

    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <div>
        <p><img src="mars.jpg" width="300px" alt="pictire of mars" align="left"/>
            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the 
            Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, 
            and is often referred to as the "Red Planet"[14][15] because the reddish iron oxide 
            prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among 
            the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[16] Mars is a terrestrial planet 
            with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters 
            of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
            The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, 
            as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest 
            volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, 
            one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern 
            hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[17][18] Mars has 
            two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be 
            captured asteroids,[19][20] similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
            There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of Mars, as 
            well as the possibility of extant life. Future astrobiology missions are planned, including 
            the Mars 2020 and ExoMars rovers.[21][22][23][24] Liquid water cannot exist on the surface 
            of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the Earth's,[25] except 
            at the lowest elevations for short periods.[26][27] The two polar ice caps appear to be made 
            largely of water.[28][29] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, 
            would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11 meters (36 ft).[30] 
            In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia 
            Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent 
            to the volume of water in Lake Superior.[31][32][33]
            Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent 
            magnitude reaches âˆ’2.91,[8] which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. 
            Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 
            kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.[34]
