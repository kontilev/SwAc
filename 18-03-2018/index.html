                    <p>The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system 
                        comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either 
                        directly or indirectly.[b] Of those objects that orbit the 
                        Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets,[c] with the 
                        remainder being smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and 
                        small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun 
                        indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, 
                        Mercury.[d]
                    </p>
                    <p>The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational
                         collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority 
                         of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the 
                         remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, 
                         Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being 
                         primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are 
                         giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. 
                         The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed 
                         mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and 
                         Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with 
                         relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, 
                         called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight 
                         planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat 
                         disc called the ecliptic.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[e] The asteroid belt, 
                        which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains 
                        objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. 
                        Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, 
                        which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, 
                        and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these 
                        populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects 
                        large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity.[10] Such 
                        objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include 
                        the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris.[e] 
                        In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, 
                        including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel 
                        between regions. Six of the planets, at least four of the dwarf planets, 
                        and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites,[f] 
                        usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is 
                        encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.
